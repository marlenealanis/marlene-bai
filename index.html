  <h1>Marlene Ranks Her Top Favorite Latin Dance Styles</h1>

  <div class="image-container">
    <div class="image">
      <img src="bachata.webp" alt="Caption 1">
      <p class="caption">Bachata ranks as my most favorite dance style because it combines all the most important factors to me in terms of presentation: it looks graceful and elegant but still dynamic enough to keep you on your toes. In terms of activity, it puts my core to work to maintain control and challenges my gracefulness.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image">
      <img src="funk.jpeg" alt="Caption 2">
      <p class="caption">Funk ranks as #2 of my top favorite dance styles because it is so energizing and free. It requires a particular conscious effort in footwork and twisting inward/outwards of your heels that is very unique.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="image">
      <img src="reggaeton.jpeg" alt="Caption 3">
      <p class="caption">Reggaeton ranks #3 because it is active, similar to funk, and can incorporate more street style dance. For me, this dance style makes me feel powerful and unstoppable.</p>
