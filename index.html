      <img src="bachata.webp" alt="Bachata ranks as #1 in my top favorite dance styles because it is so elegant and requires so much control from your core to look that way. It is so fun to play an alter ego and be mysterious and feminine in this dance style for me.">

      <img src="funk.jpeg" alt="Funk ranks as #2 of my top favorite dance styles because it is so energizing and free. It requires a particular conscious effort in footwork and twisting inward/outwards of your heels that is very unique.">

      <img src="reggaeton.jpeg" alt="Reggaeton ranks #3 because it is active, similar to funk, and can incorporate more street style dance. For me, this dance style makes me feel powerful and unstoppable.">
